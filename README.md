# bandcamp-go
A Go program for downloading Bandcamp songs, but moreso a rewrite of [bandcamp-dl](https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl).

# Installation
TODO (Package in Homebrew)

# Getting Started
With Go installed, you can just run this program  by running `go run bandcamp.go
<album/track_url>` and it will download the tracks to
`music/<album_or_track_title>`. Will create a binary soon for OS X.
